# Pacman AI

I want to see if I can create an automated pacman player that can play the game intelligently on it's own.


#### NOTE: I did not create this game!
Major props to ShaunW for recreating the entire suite of pacman games as well as great practice tools.  Thank you for publishing your source code!  I highly recommend everyone check out his page and play the game for yourself at http://pacman.shaunew.com/.  

I have merely added on to the exiting game and AI framework.
